# rice

This is not my full rice. I use scripts with sensitive information (eg. for checking mails) that I'd rather not share. And since I don't want to always have to think about what I can share and what I can't, my main repo is private.

This repo will therefore not be updated on a regular basis and there might be some references to files that are nowhere to be found.

If you have questions on how something works or if you want me to put more into this git, feel free to contact me (/u/jarvick257).
